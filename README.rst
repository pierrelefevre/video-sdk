Editing and Building the Documentation
###############################################################


****************************************
Overview
****************************************

The .rst sources for the documentation are located in the ``sources`` directory of the ``gh-pages`` branch of this repository. The ``sources`` directory contains subdirectories (``vX.Y``) corresponding to each release of the SDK. Each of these subdirectories contains the documentation sources for that particular release.

The documentation is generated using a Makefile located in the ``build`` directory at the root of the ``gh-pages`` branch.

The HTML output for the sources in a particular ``gh-pages/sources/vX.Y`` directory is placed in a corresponding ``vX.Y`` directory at the root of the ``gh-pages`` branch.


****************************************
Prerequisites
****************************************

Building the HTML documentation requires Sphinx and some of its extensions. These dependencies must be installed as shown below. This requires a Python 3 installation.

::

  pip3 install -U sphinx
  pip3 install recommonmark
  pip3 install sphinx-copybutton
  pip3 install sphinx-markdown-tables
  pip3 install rst2pdf


****************************************
General Workflow
****************************************

#. Make your edits in the desired ``sources/vX.Y`` directory
#. From the root of the cloned branch, generate the HTML documentation using Sphinx::

    make -C build all

#. Open the generated HTML documentation in a web browser::

    firefox ./index.html &

#. Inspect the generated HTML in your web browser to check if it meets expectations
#. When appropriate, submit a pull request to the ``gh-pages`` branch of the ``video-sdk`` repository


****************************************
Details about the Sphinx Setup
****************************************

The ``conf.py`` file contains the settings of the Sphinx project. Noteworthy project settings include:

- The version and release information

- The master doc is set to ``index.rst``

- Onyl .rst files are processes, files with the .md extension are ignored

- The ``|SDK|`` macro will be automatically replaced by ``Xilinx Video SDK`` in all .rst files

- ``html_show_sourcelink`` is set to False, which prevents the generation of the "View page source" link in the HTML pages

- The ``exclude_patterns`` option is used to exclude certain directories from processing by Sphinx. Files which are included in other .rst files (with the ``.. include::`` directive) should be placed in excluded directories so that they don't get processed as standalone files::

	exclude_patterns = ['README.rst', 'include', 'examples/xma/include']

- The `sphinx.ext.extlinks extension <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/extlinks.html>`_ is enabled, and various ``extlinks`` are defined, providing convenient URL shortcuts usable in the RST sources.
